# VR-Template-Unity
 
**Who is it for?**
I made this for students and people who want to get into VR development a bit faster without the hassle of going through all these small and obscure settings.

**What is it?**
This Git not only contains all the packages but also the project, build settings and all other small steps to setup VR unity!

> **BONUS!** I also added the adb tool. You can use it to upload your own
> APK's to Oculus Quest without having to use the Meta Quest Link
> software. You can download newer or other version [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).  
>
>It is meant for people who are working on laptops in Unity
> without access to work stations. (make sure the Quest is in developer
> mode though)

**Why?**
There are a lot of great tutorials to set-up your simple Unity project as a VR project. 
However, I found it difficult at first because the tutorials often contain a lot of steps with obscure settings or actions that are hard to remember every time you start up a new VR project.
